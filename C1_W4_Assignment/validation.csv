__label__-1 "this jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif . however it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store . this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time . it 's a big shame because it 's so perfect in every other way . i choose not to buy it . it 's very expensive for the quality ."

__label__0 "the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person . the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i 'd imagined from the photos . it has a quilted quality so does n't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms . i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large . i think a medium might have been better . have n't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return . has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like ."
__label__1 "this dress is really beautiful and high quality . the pattern color and fabric are great . the fit is flattering ( i 'm hourglass to pear shaped ) and the size perfect for me in petite . please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers ."
__label__-1 "i also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images . it is very thin as others have said . the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured . it is more similar to a cape or shawl design . if you ; 're looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design this is not it . i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design ."
__label__-1 "definitely agree with the other reviewers . this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life . super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs . if you plan on ordering i 'd recommend sizing down ."
__label__-1 "this dress was not what i had hoped ! from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap . the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress . needless to say it 's going back !"
__label__1 "beautiful sweater ! ! i love the color and the fit . the cowl neck is n't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy . it comes down to the low hip on me . very soft and cozy . i purchased the aqua in xs . fits perfectly and i 'm 5 5 ' 127lbs ."
__label__0 "this cute dress was very nice on . however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves . the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms . i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same . other than that the colors and dress are beautiful ."
__label__0 "i was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print but when i finally received i was a little disappointed . the print placement is not the same as shown on the model so it does n't look as a vibrant and colorful . my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise . also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined . i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling . the dress fits nicely in size medium on"

__label__-1 "this top is beautiful - even more so in person . however like a previous reviewer the fit is very boxy . there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you ca n't see in the photos due to the model 's cardigan and arms . if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted without all the excess fabric at the bottom it would have been perfect . again the color the lace the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous . would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came"

( i 'm 5 ' 7 '' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2 ) . i did n't even try buttoning all the way . i took it back and i do n't even think i want a larger size . the buttons are just too fragile ."
__label__1 "beautiful dress but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist . it runs huge : i 'm 5 ' 6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best . there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist . i received a lot of compliments on this dress ! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes ."

__label__-1 "i 'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses especially the petite xs maxis . this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made . it was humongous and gave me no shape . even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same . i 'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess -- which also makes no sense because it 's the petite size . do not buy . i 'm very upset i have to pay the $ 5.95 return fee since i ordered this ."
__label__1 "i was n't immediately attracted to this shirt but decided to try it on . i loved it on ! it is comfortable and very flattering . i 'm a small person and the length was n't overbearing on me . it was full but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person . i 'm not sure how it works on a fuller person but my guess is it may surprise you !"

__label__0 "loved the material but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium . im 5 ' 5 and there was atleast 5 of material at my feet . the gaps in the front are much wider than they look . felt like the dress just fell flat . both were returned . im usually a large and the med fit better . 36d 30 in jeans"
__label__0 "these are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough . i would go down a size for sure . the cons are n't unsolvable so try them out !"
__label__1 "nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes . as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small . i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over and uncomfortable . i do n't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great . sizing definitely off on these . i am 5 ' 3 115 # for reference ."
__label__-1 "this dress really was huge and not at all flattering . i do n't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture . material was nice and soft but i really do n't see how anyone could look good in this no matter what your body shape is ."
__label__-1 "the top is more of a cream color than an ivory . it 's also a bit boxer than anticipated . fit is true to size ."
__label__0 "i stalked this blouse and when the price dropped i pounced on the black . sadly it did nothing for me . i 'm a large sometimes medium but decided on the large . you 'd think it came with its own cami at this price but no . completely sheer . unwearable without one . the lace is nothing special . the collar is wider in the back uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front . the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back . i 'm returning this one ."
__label__0 "i ordered the petite in my size since i 'm well petite but curvy . i recommend this dress if you do n't have a lot of boobage . unfortunately for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way . its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it . it fits but just is not flattering because of my boobs . this is always my problem though with dresses ."

__label__1 "very nice top fits true to size a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants"
__label__0 "this jacket is extremely soft and comfortable with a heavier textured fabric . i think it is expensive for what it is -- $ 138 -- probably best to wait for a sale"
__label__0 "although the design and quality were great this did not work for me . it was boxy square and overwhelmed my petite frame . if you are taller or have a longer torso this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "dress was a disappoint . very thin and cheaply made not worth the money at all . pictures make it look much better than in real life . top area is also made small so if you are busty this is not the dress for you ."
__label__0 "totally pretty but not crazy flattering . a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall . good on sale but i would n't pay full price ."
__label__0 "delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness . loved the unmatched buttons checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy . easyily dress it up or down that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight . i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build . ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect !"

__label__1 "tried it on at the local store today it is very pretty ! i believe i runs large . i am usually a small but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly . it is made of thick linen and has a lining ."
__label__-1 "i 'm upset . i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper the picture of the grey does not have a zipper . i prefer no zipper so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper i was disappointed . it 's going back . why have a model where an item that you 're not offering ? ? ?"
__label__-1 "i assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater . unfortunately it is made of cheap looking material that is 50 % acrylic and see-through ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love these but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind . the fabric is so soft however and the color is great . would work on a less curvy woman !"

__label__0 "ordered size 12 it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection . also way too long hits below my knees . the dress is beautiful : crisp black color nice fabric great neck . it 's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good . i had to return mine ."
__label__0 "nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle . they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant perhaps ."
__label__1 "i love these jeans ! i really like the way they fit and have n't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have ."
__label__1 "i was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand but i 'm a little unsure . the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5 ' 4 frame yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides . i 'm just not sure it hangs right on me . it 's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely and looks great with the front loosely tucked . just not what i was expecting ."

__label__1 "i feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback -- this dress is killer ! it 's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan . it 's body skimming but lined so it does n't cling to flaws the knit itself is substantial and it 's a mockneck not a turtleneck . i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large . because of weight and lining this is a spring and early fall dress"
__label__0 "while there is nothing wrong with this top it did n't really have an retailer feel . it looked more like something from a dept store maybe a boutique . i got on sale but sending back bc i just do n't like it that much especially next to my pale skin . i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone . i 'm usually a 8/10 med . small in this top fit well ."
__label__1 "i love love love the fit in the corduroy so thought about grabbing these jeans as well . they fit much pretty well just the color was n't quite right . i 'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans and these do n't quite match the coloring in the photo . still debating whether to keep them . love the cuff styling and straight leg fit !"
__label__0 "the fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me . sadly it looked ridiculous on me . i would n't recommend the top for busty girls . it looked like a bell on me . fyi it does n't come with a camisole underneath ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online . the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering . i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it ."
__label__0 "i really like this shirt but it 's a bit maternity . i do n't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here . i 'm 5 ' 7 about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret . since i 'm done having kids it has to go back . it 's also somewhat see through and had i kept it i would have worn a tank top underneath . as long as these things do n't bother you it really is cute !"
__label__-1 "i love the design that 's why i 'm going back for a smaller size . i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i 'm good at choosing my size online but not today . if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room . also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on please !"
__label__1 "i got the purple color and absolutely love it . i am 5 ' 2 but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer . i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm . it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely !"
__label__0 "unfortunately this dress ran very large on me ( please no more vanity sizing ! ) and minimized what few curves i have . my store did n't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist . it also flares out quite a bit you can see this in the catalog shot . while this was n't flattering on me it may work better on curvier figures ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this top in a 14 my usual size and it fits fine but it is way too short-waisted ! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing . her top comes low on her waist almost to her crotch area . mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button ! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory ! very strange ."
__label__0 "i do n't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do . it fits a little bit weird on me and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit ( the knot is not adjustable ) . the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs so i ca n't size down . the knit is substantial so that 's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just was n't flattering on me . i had recently bought and loved lilke 's tideline pencil skirt which also has a fabric tie wrap"
__label__1 "like all maeve tops of this nature i am absolutely in love ! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top . this top looks great with jeans shorts skirts etc . i purchased it in all 3 colors . the blue is more of a robins egg blue the orange is a great tangerine color ( perfect for us tennessee fans ! ) and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white . the ivory is my favorite because it 's a very unique color .. i have a ton of white and ivory tops but i do not have one in a color like this"
__label__1 "these legging are adorable . i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome . the buttons at the ankle are cute . i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i do n't like to spend so much on leggings ."
__label__0 "i 'm tall and small chested so the dress did n't fit me perfectly . i adore the color and pattern but wish it was less revealing in the chest area . i definitely have to wear something under . otherwise high quality and unique dress !"
__label__0 "i bought both black and white shirt . white is see through completely . black is ok. but the material is still too thin . i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money . i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap ."
__label__-1 "the fabric and color are absolutely beautiful . the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist and enormous everywhere else . it was not flattering ."
__label__1 "the color and quality of these jeans is great . they were too large in my normal size . more of a boyfriend fit so size down ."
__label__1 "fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off . the fabric is not stretchy . the lining is a nice navy . however the sleeves are not lined . the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it . it hit me at my waist . i 'm 5 ' 3 118 # . i loved this top . worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow . this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace ."
__label__1 "several reviews have stated this dress is embroidered with a popsicles . it is not embroidered but an attractive popsicle print . i usually wear a 2p and after reading review ordered an 8p . a bit roomy in waist but with tie at waist it works . length great but arm holes large . will have altered as this fit/flare shirtwaist dress is so flattering ."
__label__0 "thought i 'd love this top ; i 'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer . but i found the lace while pretty to be quite rough which to me indicates a lower quality . and i guess i should 've known that it would be very swingy ( photos show that ) but it really overwhelmed me . for reference 5 ' 5 125 lbs 34d . sad but this went back ."
__label__0 "im 5 ' 1 and about 110lbs . ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all . the wool was very soft and stretchy . and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color . it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure . might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $ 100 ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large or something ? ! i ordered an xs my usual size xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose the upper arms are a bit snug and i do n't have large arms . the shoulder seams are in a very strange place but when you look at the model it does n't look so bad . with the shirt i received and another reviewer the seam was puffy making for a strange look . in theory the shirt should have worked but did n't . i loved the pattern not the fit ."
__label__1 "this is a really elegant sweater coat -- the faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the mismatching color blocks on each side keeps things playful . the material is soft and cozy but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged . otherwise though it 's a winner !"
__label__1 "easy to wear and very cute especially for curvy ladies . but i think it looks best worn with a best or a blazer on top something to emphasize the waist a bit more ."
__label__0 "i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece . i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate . next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back . it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear . lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined . but it does have pockets that is sweet ."
__label__0 "beautiful dress with the colors and pleats . i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did . my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn & # 39 ; t lay flat even when just hanging on the hanger . when actually on a person the zipper juts out . had to be returned !"
__label__1 "i tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on . it 's beautifully made the fabric is soft comfortable and free-moving and overall it has a lovely vintage romantic look . i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well especially the lovely way the fabric draped . another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped ; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie but once tha"

__label__1 "this dress is perfect . i 'm literally wearing it right now . it 's crazy comfortable while still being flattering . it looks and feels high quality and just barely does n't hit the floor . it makes me feel like a goddess . plenty of room in the bust area even for me ( 36dd ) and does n't show bra straps or underwear . highly recommended !"
__label__0 "i liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt . pretty seam down the back and weight of material . i 'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought ."
__label__-1 "this shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it . i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops and smaller on top- barely 34b . this top was incredibly unflattering falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy -- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit . there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me . it 's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall . unfortunately"
__label__-1 "it hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front . the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap . i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned . did not fit well and was not good quality . very thin"
__label__0 "i ordered this in the orange color from online . they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium ( regular ) . i liked it but just not flattering . i am 5 ' 2 and the coat was too big . sleeves were past my hands . i think because i 'm curvy the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small . it was a nice coat just not for me ."
__label__-1 "the length of this dress is bizarre . i ca n't decide if it 's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i 'm not sure if i like it either way . also- at this price point i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent . if you buy this dress be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people can not see your underwear . the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur"

__label__1 "love the cotton knit for the comfort but from a distance this blouse looks dressier . the embroidery adds a nice flare . personally i was happy that this is long enough to cover my bottom as it gives it a nice lean look with skinny jeans and pants . i found that it ran a little bit but choose to keep the size i ordered anyway ."

__label__-1 "just recently purchased and think it 's ok for the price . would never pay full on this one & that 's from an retailer shopper who 's purchased plenty at full price . design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly the pockets bunch up weirdly ( steaming/laundering do n't help ) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly . could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering did n't help that issue either ."

__label__1 "i did n't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold . yes it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work . the best feature ? even though it 's silk and the tag says dry clean only you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry . i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles ! i took my usual small ( i 'm 32c and 122 lbs ) and love how versatile this blouse will be ."
__label__-1 "quality was not what you expect from retailer especially for the price . top is lined but skirt is not . material is tissue paper thin and see thru . there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat it keeps popping up . however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives . was returned ."
__label__1 "love the design and print . absolutely beautiful bathing suit . would size up on the bottoms . top is true to size ."
__label__-1 "# childsize . not sure where this went wrong but it 's going back immediately . always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small . the material is beautiful but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric . so disappointing ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such . this really does have a lot going on . i usually wear a 4 in skirts and based on reviews went up one size . it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small ! it 's sooooo tiny at the waist . probably buy 2 sizes 2 and 3 sizes up from your own . also the skirt flares super wide at the sides it does n't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand . it 's like a skirt"
__label__1 "so i love this top . i got it in black and red . both are amazing and go with about anything . they run a bit large . i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck . i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry . i would say it shrunk 10 % at most . beyond that no difference . in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big . obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i"
__label__1 "i ordered : xsp xxs xxsp xxsp was the better fit some people loved it some did n't like as much ( thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing . but that being said ti was comfortable the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans . i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me ( like sticky white ) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m"
__label__0 "definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt . just too large ; too much fabric for me . i 'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod . i would n't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top . i think the colors are also a bit duller in person . love the concept though !"
__label__-1 "this top is very soft and well made . for my short and curvy figure it is very unflattering . i considered altering it but there is no way to do it . it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all it wo n't show because this top is boxy and full in that area . if you are tall and slim it might be perfect so give it a try ."
__label__-1 "too small ... too flare ... nice thick fabric . not my favorite pant ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this skirt it was good quality but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it"
__label__-1 "loved the fit and colors but the fabric is very thin and see-thru . i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible . it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to ."
__label__1 "great flattering fit lovely light fabric classy with an edge . getting another one the other color ! stripes on the taupe one are navy -"
__label__1 "this is a beautiful piece -- and a really great deal on sale . it is sheer but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit !"
__label__1 "this cardigan is utterly gorgeous . way prettier on than i feared . my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms and so i finally looked closely at the tag . the tag says the * back * section ( which looks exactly like the weave on the arms ) has a measly 5 % wool snuck into the fabric content . why retailer ? why wool ? i am so sensitive to it ! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it . now i have a problem"
__label__0 "the dress is well made with a great material . it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women . i returned it ."
__label__1 "i was pleasantly surprised with this one . fits a bit large . i 'm 8-10 the 8 fits just right . the moss is a great staple color ."
__label__1 "i love the fabric since it 's fall was n't expecting it to be light . but its not heavy either . just the right balance . this is one of those classics . i love the collage like pattern of the fabric . the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots . ( dressed up or down ) ."
__label__-1 "after reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea . as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big . for reference i am 5 ' 3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous . it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant . it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon . such a disappointment . the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and"
__label__1 "i love this gown so much i would wear it everyday if i could . it is cozy beautiful and feels special like an heirloom . the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft . color is much prettier than the photo picks up ! ! ! i love this gown . my favorite hands down ."
__label__-1 "this dress is gorgeous as displayed at store . color is vibrant but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily . i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived . the top is very wide and best to wear strapless ."
__label__1 "i have several lilka pj bottoms and i 'm glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection ! tts soft flannel striking colors only wish they had pockets !"
__label__1 "ca n't say about fit just yet since it is a gift ; color is soft green and versatile . finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt"
__label__0 "i bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i 'm not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee . the gray is light and as pictured in the photo . i bought an xl and the fit is tailored with some loose flow to it . it is not boxy or big on me . the fabric is a soft soft thin cotton knit and very cool for hot muggy summer days .... esp . in the southern us where it can be pretty intense . since i bought the gray it 's not sheer al"
__label__1 "i ordered size small . i am 5 ' 6 32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great . there 's an adorable little quote on the pantie 's lining and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining . the feel of the lace and fabric is divine . love it ! one more thing to note ... there is very little lining in the bra ; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric . it is enough to protect modesty but not much else ."
__label__1 "absolutely love everything about this dress . unlike many other dresses i 've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest ( 34c ) . it 's very flattering . love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen . ca n't wait to wear it . i got the s regular . if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small . i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right . like it was made for me"
__label__1 "i am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here .... this has to be the best thing i 've ever purchased . it is so soft and beautiful . i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ... fits perfectly and does n't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing . it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that 's so perfect a little different and not a defect . it is not itchy whats so ever . i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo"
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 4 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie . i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you 're 5 ' 8 and above ? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm body and skirt . a belt was no match for that much fabric . the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made but the design was awful ."
__label__-1 "i 'm petite but even if i were n't i think this runs very large is n't form flattering at all and overall looks dull . it most definitely does not justify the price . material is thin ."
__label__0 "i usually wear small ordered xs and it 's still way too large . quality not that great just meh returning it ."
__label__0 "i 'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay . loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress . i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes ... well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite ! ! ! and i 'm 5 ' 9 . the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha"
__label__0 "i am 5 ' 7 with an athletic build ( small chest small waist muscular hips/thighs ) . this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am . i purchased a small an extra small would be way too short . i could see how it works for fuller figured girls ."
__label__-1 "the catalog shot and model shot are completely different . it 's like not even the same dress . the neckline color the quality of lace"
__label__0 "this beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store . the coloring is lovely but it was too short for me ( 5 ' 7 ) and just meh ... and it was only on for a second before it started itching . sadly too the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes ( i wish they 'd stop doing this ) . if it works for you great because it 's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter"
